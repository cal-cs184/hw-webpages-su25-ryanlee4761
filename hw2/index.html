		<h2>Section I: Bezier Curves and Surfaces</h2>

		<h3>Part 1: Bezier curves with 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>
		<p>de Casteljau’s algorithm is a method for interpolating a bezier curve. Given a parameter t (between 0 and 1) and some
		defined control points, we can interpolate some point within the curve around the location defined by t. To implement
		this for this assignment, I implemented a single recursive step to reduce from n to n-1 control points closer to the
		curve. Between each of the available control points, we selected a point between each pair based on the t parameter and
		returned those as a vector for the next control step. This way, we would continue to choose all future points by some
		parameter t and eventually find the point on the curve that corresponded to the t value.</p>

		<h3>Part 2: Bezier surfaces with separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
		<p>We can extend de Casteljau’s algorithm from 1D lines to a 2D surface by treating the NxN surface as N sets of N lines.
		Along each of these lines, we can execute de Casteljau’s algorithm with some parameter u to find the corresponding point
		from each of the N lines. With these N points, we can construct a line of N points in the second dimension, and use the
		parameter v to select the corresponding point as parametrized by the NxN control points and u/v parameters.</p>

		<h2>Section II: Triangle Meshes and Half-Edge Data Structure</h2>

		<h3>Part 3: Area-weighted vertex normals</h3>
		<p>Given the original vertex, I used its halfedge to iterate through all the fanning faces surrounding the vertex with the
		condition h != halfEdge() (of the vertex) and incremented with h→twin()→next(). In each iteration, I obtained the other
		vertices of the triangle using h, and computed the area-weighted normal by crossing (v2-v1) x (v3-v1). I accumulated
		these vectors in a final vector, which I normalized before returning as the Area-weighted Vertex Normal.</p>

		<h3>Part 4: Edge flip</h3>
		<p>To flip an edge, I first gathered all relevant halfedges, faces, and vertices in variables for easier access and
		editing. Once I did this and confirmed no faces were on a boundary, I updated the face and vertex halfedges to ensure
		they were properly assigned. I omitted the edges since they weren’t being changed. For the halfedges, I ensured that I
		reassigned the face/next/vertex of the flipped edge, and updated the cycles(nexts) and faces of the remaining halfedges.</p>
		<p>My edge kept disappearing when I was coding this function. I think this was due to improper assignments resulting in the
		next parameters not being properly assigned, so no triangles were displayed after flipping. I think the main thing was
		just a single incorrect variable being referenced so that was painful.</p>

		<h3>Part 5: Edge split</h3>
		<p>Edge splitting was similar to flipping edges at the start where I gathered all relevant components. Then, I initialized
		the required new components of 1 vertex, 2 face, 3 edges, and 6 halfedges. With this, I could update edges, faces, and
		vertices relatively simply. After that, I went through each halfedge and confirmed they had the correct cycles/next
		values as well as the rest of their values. I made sure I had some consistent naming convention that matched what I had
		for edge flipping, so getting started wasn’t too bad. For debugging, I selected vertices to determine why 1/4 triangles
		were missing and find what it corresponded to in my drawings.</p>
		<p>I didn’t notice that there were functions to initialize new vertices/faces/edges/halfedges so I spent a while debugging
		some errors I kept getting. This did help me catch a few bugs in triangle halfedge cycles, but I was super stuck until I
		found that I misassigned a vertex for a halfedge. I also had a drawing of what my naming conventions were so that helped
		the initial step be easier but I was super stuck on what I could be doing wrong until I grouped halfedges by the face
		they belonged to.</p>

		<h3>Part 6: Loop subdivision for mesh upsampling</h3>
		<p>I implemented loop subdivision using the provided outline. I initially calculated the final vertex positions for both
		existing vertices and future vertices that would be interpolated between edges. I also marked these existing components
		as isNew = false for future use. After this, I compiled a vector of existing edges and split them all, updating their
		newPosition to be what I calculated earlier and while ensuring that only relevant edges were marked as isNew = true
		(which caused much pain for me). Following this, I use this property of edges as well as the new/old vertex labels to
		determine which edges to flip. Finally, I updated the positions of all vertices in the mesh for the final smooth images.</p>
		<p>Sharp corners and edges are turned into slightly oblong curves since they aren’t nicely shown to be a smooth curve. By
		pre-splitting the edges, these sharp edges/corners end up appearing smoother/flatter when performing loop subdivisions.</p>
		<p>By pre-processing such that each face of the cube had the same number of edges, we could alleviate the effects of the
		asymmetry since the balanced number of edges result in equal number of vertices and subdivisions for each face.</p>
