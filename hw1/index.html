		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>This homework covered the implementations of a rasterizer, beginnging with basic triangle drawing and antialiasing via supersampling, to using barycentric coordinates for color interpolation and mipmaps with level + pixel sampling for texture mapping.</p>
		<p>These techniques all come together to display almost any image or text or figure on any given computer screen. Being able to implement these and learn more about the implementation details was both frustrating and rewarding, but I enjoyed learning about things like the simplicity but effectiveness of supersampling as well as the usefulness of mipmaps for smoother displays.</p>

		<h2>Task 1: Drawing Single-Color Triangles</h2>
		<p>To rasterize a given triangle, I first determine the bounding box containing the triangle. To do this, I find both the
		smallest and largest x/y values that would correspond to the corners of the box, and take the floors of the smallest and
		the ceilings of the largest for rounding. With this, I iterate through each (x,y) coordinate in the box, find the center
		of the pixel, and calculate whether a point passes all 3 line tests to determine whether or not to fill.</p>

		<p>My algorithm is no worse because it implements the same algorithm described in lecture, where I take the bounding box as
		defined and perform the line tests/calculations on each of the points contained. I don’t sample any pixels beyond the
		bounding box, making my algorithm just as good.</p>

		<h3>extra credit!</h3>
		<p>One small optimization I did was to precalculate some values. I initially was calculating \[ -(xs - x0)(y1 - y0) + (ys +
		y0)(x1 - x0) \] and the other line tests for each iteration. I changed this to precalculate \( x0*(y1 - y0) \) and \( y0*(x1 - x0) \)
		as well as the individual differences \(y1 - y0\) and \(x1 - x0\) since those are constant for each iteration and reduce the multiplication necessary for each loop.</p>

		<h2>Task 2: Antialiasing by Supersampling</h2>
		<p>My supersampling algorithm is largely the same as the original rasterization algorithm implemented in step 1. The main
		change I made was that for each (x,y) coordinate, I iterate through subsections of the pixel. I determine the increments
		by doing sqrt(supersample_rate) to get the number of samples in each dimension, then do 1/dimension to determine the
		offset within the pixel. At each of these points, I perform the line test as previously specified in step 1. The results
		for each of these iterations is saved to the sample_buffer which I modified to be sized based on the width, height, and
		sample rate.</p>

		<p>Supersampling is useful because it helps attenuate high frequencies visually and give the appearance of a smoother
		surface or line.</p>

		<p>Aside from modifying the rasterize_triangle function, I also modified the fill_pixel function to properly support
		supersampling for lines/points. I also modified the resolve_to_framebuffer to support the sample_buffer layout and to
		average the colors for a given pixel.</p>
		
		<p>This supersampling helps to antialias triangles because for pixels that are partially contained in the triangle but not
		including their centers, they are completely ignored with regular sampling. With supersampling, we can account for the
		partial overlap and represent this with a slightly lighter color for that pixel, giving a smoother appearance and less
		jagged edges.</p>
		<br>

		<p>These results are observed because the pixels along the displayed corner of the red triangle don’t always have their
		center contained within the triangle. By increasing the supersampling rate, we can have a better representation of which
		pixels are partially contained in the triangle and displaying a shade of the color to show this.</p>

		<h2>Task 4: Barycentric coordinates</h2>
		<p>Barycentric coordinates involve taking the value – in this case, colors – at the points of a triangle (or another shape)
		and using those values to estimate the values for the rest of the area within the triangle. This can be done for each
		point by measuring the distance from a point to each of the vertices of the triangle, and using the distances to
		determine how much we should weigh each of the vertices when calculating the value for the point. Once we have the
		weights, we can take a weighted sum of each of the values to determine the value for our arbitrary point.</p>

		<h2>Task 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mapping</h2>
		<p>Pixel sampling involves finding some correspondence between a pixel being displayed and some pixel on a texture being
		displayed. In pixel sampling, the display may be distorted relative to the texture, so we must find a mapping between
		pixels in the two spaces. Given a triangle in both space and texture coordinates, I used barycentric coordinates to find
		the distance of some point from each vertex of the triangle containing it. With this, I could calculate the relative
		weight of each vertex on the point, and use these weights to scale from the texture coordinates.</p>

		<p>Nearest pixel sampling involves using the calculated (u,v) coordinates and simply finding the nearest pixel in the
		texture for use. On the other hand, bilinear sampling takes the surrounding 4 pixels and does a weighted sum based on
		their distance to calculate an average color to use.</p>

		<p>In these images, the bilinear sampling is able to display the latitude lines with some opacity to allow for the sand
		biome underneath to be visible. Meanwhile, the nearest sampling results in a solid white line that blocks on some
		details.</p>


		<h2>Task 6: "Level Sampling" with mipmaps for texture mapping</h2>
		<p>Level sampling uses similar techniques to pixel sampling where we have different space coordinates and texture
		coordinates. By mapping space coordinates to texture coordinates, we can determine how zoomed in we are to the texture,
		which refers to our level. With this knowledge, we can choose different levels of quality when sampling for our image
		that is optimal for displaying at the level of magnification we are at.</p>
		
		<p>To implement this, I implemented a function to get the level based on the space coordinates and translating them to
		texture coordinates, as well as the resulting texture coordinates from incrementing the space coordinates. Then,
		depending on the sp.lsm selected, I passed this level into the nearest or bilinear pixel sampling so the correct mipmap
		level could be accessed. For the case of the linear level sampling, I made two calls to the pixel sampling and took a
		weighted sum of them.</p>
		<br>

		<p>Increasing pixel sampling can be costly because it requires several arithmetic operations and memory accesses. However,
		a good pixel sampling can be useful for displaying textures well. Similarly, level sampling are extremely useful to
		reduce artifacts in a texture with varying levels. However, doing linear level sampling compared to the nearest level
		also has nearly double the number of arithmetic operations. Using supersampling can also be extremely costly and time
		consuming, but the results are much smoother and clearer than with regular sampling or sampling at a smaller rate.</p>
